Flexy
=====

A simple Flexbox layout extension for Compass. Open [_flexy-demo.scss](https://github.com/Guilh/Flexy/blob/master/templates/project/_flexy-demo.scss) to see how it works, or [install the gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/flexy)!

Watch my [latest Treehouse course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/creating-a-compass-extension) to learn how I built this extension. :)
